### Wallet Compatibility

Most Ethereum-compatible wallets work with Chain, allowing for a smooth transition and interaction within the Chain ecosystem.

### Associated Risks

Despite high security and reliability efforts, it's essential to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with blockchain transactions.

### For Blockchain Beginners
