### How do network fees on Chain work?

Every Chain Network transaction consists of two costs: an L2 (execution) fee and an L1 (security) fee. The L2 fee is the cost to execute your transaction on the L2, and the L1 fee is the estimated cost to publish the transaction on the L1. Typically the L1 security fee is higher than the L2 execution fee.

The L1 fee will vary depending on the amount of transactions on the L1. If the timing of your transaction is flexible, you can save costs by submitting transactions during periods of lower gas on the L1 (for example, over the weekend)

Similarly, the L2 fee can increase and decrease depending on how many transactions are being submitted to the L2. This adjustment mechanism has the same implementation as the L1; you can read more about it here.

### What is zentachain?

Zentachain is a privacy-centric blockchain network aimed at secure communication and data storage solutions. It connects decentralized network dynamic routing with AI mesh networking to safeguard user privacy and ensure the confidentiality of data and communications through hybrid encryption techniques.

### What is the zentalk messaging application?

Zentalk is a decentralized messaging app offering secure communication by leveraging blockchain technology. It maintains connectivity even in offline scenarios, such as during network outages, by utilizing the Zentamesh network for data exchange.

### How does the zentamesh network work?

Zentamesh is a mesh network facilitating secure communication and data sharing between IoT devices. It operates on a decentralized network of Zentanodes, acting as gateways or hubs, to ensure continuous connectivity under various conditions.

### What advanced technologies does zentamesh incorporate?

The network incorporates ANN (Artificial Neural Network) technology and Q-learning algorithms, enabling it to adapt and improve through machine learning, thus enhancing its communication and data-sharing capabilities.

### Why is chain network necessary for zentanode?

Zentanode provides a robust offline telecommunications experience, acting like a high-quality router for internet access. It's a crucial component of the Zentamesh network, allowing for offline communication and connectivity.

### What are Zentanode network rewards?

Owning a Zentanode and participating in the Zentamesh network allows users to earn Chain tokens as rewards, incentivizing support and contribution to the network's growth.

### What is staking in the chain network?

Staking Chain tokens offers users the opportunity to earn rewards through an annual percentage rate (APR), enhancing the token's utility and encouraging long-term participation in the ecosystem.

### What features does zentalk offer?

Zentalk provides privacy-focused messaging with offline capabilities, encrypted data exchange via Zentamesh, anonymous online messaging through the Tor network, and a high level of security with advanced encryption protocols. It operates independently of personal information like phone numbers or emails.

### How to Use Zentalk?

To utilize Zentalk, users must be within the range of a Zentanode and possess Chain tokens. The application supports various networks, including BLE, WiFi, 4G, 5G, and radio, for versatile communication options.
