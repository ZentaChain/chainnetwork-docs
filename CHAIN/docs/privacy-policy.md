# Privacy Policy

Last updated: Feb 17, 2024

---

At Zentachain (referred to here as “we”, “us”, or “our”), we prioritize and safeguard the privacy of our users and developers (“you” and “your” or “Users” and “Developers”, as relevant) who engage with Zentachain (“Zentachain”) through the Zentachain protocol or any other applications, tools, and features we provide (collectively, the “Services”).

This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, utilize, and disclose personal information when you utilize our Services, which encompass the services available on our website https://devs-chain.zentachain.io/ (“Site”). Please note that this Privacy Policy does not extend to any processing conducted by Zentachain as a processor on behalf of Users and Developers who engage with Zentachain. Additionally, it's important to recognize that we do not oversee websites, applications, or services operated by third parties, and thus, we cannot be held accountable for their practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other websites, decentralized applications, or services you utilize to access or interact with our Services.

We collect the following personal information when providing the Services:

- **Your public wallet address (“Wallet Address”)**
- **Publicly available blockchain data (“Blockchain Data”)**

Where you agree to engage in our surveys or sign up to receive marketing communications about Zentachain products and offerings, we will ask for the following “Basic User Information”:

- Name
- Email
- Social media handles
- Business name

### App, Browser, & Device

- Information about the device, operating system, and browser you’re using
- Other device characteristics or identifiers (e.g., plugins, the network you connect to)
- IP address/derived location information

### Companies (“Affiliates”)

We may obtain information about you, such as Basic User Information, from our Affiliates (for instance, if you use Zentachain with your Zentachain-hosted wallet) as part of facilitating, supporting, or providing our Services.

### Blockchain

We may analyze public blockchain data, including timestamps of transactions or events, transaction IDs, digital signatures, transaction amounts, and wallet addresses.

### Providers

We receive information about your website usage and interactions from third-party analytics providers. This includes browser fingerprint, device information, and IP address.

### Error

We leverage insights from external service providers to enhance our automated error management system, including monitoring, alerting, reporting, and diagnostics for Service and Site issues. This initiative is designed to boost the effectiveness of Users and Developers working within the Zentachain ecosystem.

Your personal data is pivotal for various operational and strategic purposes, as outlined below. It's important to note that for those residing outside the United Kingdom or the European Economic Area (EEA), the legal basis for processing your data may differ from what is specified here.

| Purpose | Information Utilized | Legal Basis |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Delivery of Zentachain Services | Wallet Address, Blockchain Data | Contractual Necessity |
| Enhancing Service Safety, Security, and Integrity | Basic User Information, Analytics Data | Contractual Necessity |
| Enabling Efficient Development on Zentachain | Error Tracking Data | Legitimate Interests |
| Distribution of Zentachain Forms for Marketing and Product Development | Basic User Information | Legitimate Interests |


Zentachain collaborates with various service providers, partners, and third parties to enhance the delivery of our Services. Here's an overview of our information-sharing practices:

**Affiliates:** To facilitate seamless business operations and deliver our Services effectively, we may exchange Basic User Information across our network of affiliates, services, and employees.

**Third-Party Websites or Services:** Utilizing third-party services or websites connected through our Services (such as linking your self-custodial wallet to decentralized applications) may result in the sharing of your information (e.g., wallet address) with those third-party entities. It's important to note that these third-party services or websites operate under their own terms and privacy policies, not governed by this Privacy Policy.

**Professional Advisors, Industry Partners, Authorities, and Regulators:** Information outlined in Section 1 regarding what we collect may be shared with our advisors, regulators, tax authorities, law enforcement, government agencies, and industry partners as necessary to:
- Comply with applicable laws, regulations, court orders, legal processes, or government requests.
- Detect, investigate, and mitigate fraud, illegal activities, or security and technical issues.
- Ensure the protection of our Users, Developers, Affiliates, or others' rights, property, and safety, including preventing death or imminent bodily harm.

**Third-Party Service Providers:** We engage third-party service providers to assist in providing our Services more efficiently. These providers are obligated to use your information solely based on our instructions and terms, ensuring processing is limited strictly to the purposes of their contractual obligations.

### Duration
Zentachain retains your personal information as long as necessary to deliver our Services, fulfill legal obligations, or protect our or third parties' interests. Although retention laws vary by jurisdiction, our internal policies determine retention periods based on the purpose for which the information was collected or created. This encompasses considerations like the collection time, its necessity for ongoing service provision, the importance of maintaining our Services' safety, security, and integrity, and legal retention requirements.

### Children's
Our Services do not target individuals under 18 years of age. We do not intentionally gather or solicit data from minors. If you are below 18, please refrain from providing any personal information via our Site or Services. Should we suspect that a user is under 18, we will promptly delete their personal data.

### International
To support our worldwide operations, data may be transferred and stored globally, including in the United States, by us, our partners, and service providers.

For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, we utilize various legal frameworks to ensure the lawful transfer of personal information ("European Personal Data").

Our primary mechanism for transferring European Personal Data to non-EU countries, including the United States, is the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses. We also leverage adequacy decisions from the European Commission and applicable exemptions under data protection law (e.g., Article 49 of the GDPR) when necessary.

### Contacting us
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or if you wish to lodge a complaint, please reach out to us at team@zentachain.io.

### Updates
We continually strive to enhance our Services, necessitating occasional updates to this Privacy Policy. We will post any changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, provide a more prominent notice as required by law. The last revision date of this policy is noted at the beginning of this document.

### Relationship
Zentachain, based in Germany, acts as the controller of your personal data. Our commitment to your privacy is paramount, and we adhere to German and applicable EU data protection laws to safeguard your information.
