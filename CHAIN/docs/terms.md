Welcome to Zentachain. Located in the heart of Berlin, Germany, Zentachain is at the forefront of Layer 2 optimistic rollup technology on the Ethereum blockchain. These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you (the user) and Zentachain GmbH ("Zentachain," "we," or "us"), governing your use of our Sequencer, Bridge Interface, and Testnet (collectively, "Services").
