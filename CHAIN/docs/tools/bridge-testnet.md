# Testnet

The Chain Bridge serves as a key link in the Chain Network testnet, facilitating the seamless transfer of ETH and designated ERC-20 tokens between the Ethereum Sepolia network and the Chain Network testnet. This bridge is an essential tool for users and developers working within these ecosystems, providing a straightforward and efficient method to move assets back and forth between Sepolia and the Chain Network's test environment. It's an ideal setup for testing and development, ensuring a smooth transition and compatibility of assets across these interconnected blockchain platforms.
